# JavaScript, the whole thing

## Entry requirements

TODO, summarise what a learner should already have learnt / demonstrated
before they start this unit.

- know about fruit
- have completed [the cooking course](cooking.md)

## Exit goals

TODO, summarise what a learner would have achieved by the end of this unit.
i.e. what might fulfil the entry requirements of another unit, or what another unit
can understand if _this_ unit is listed as an entry requirement.

## Out of scope

TODO, Anything that we wish explicitly to state is _not_ within the scope of this unit.

## Detail

TODO, list how a learner gets from Entry to Exit:

- what it is
  - trivial example use in browser
  - trivial example use outside of browser
- hello, world
  - `console.log`
  - `const`
  - simple DOM example (e.g. `getElementById` then set `.value =` something)
- [data types](./javascript_data_types.md)
- functions
  - defining and calling
  - passing values
  - return a value
  - named vs arrow functions
  - `...args`
- asynchronous processing
  - why (server `readFileSync()`, or browser `prompt()`, considered harmful)
  - one solution to this problem: callbacks
  - the generally preferred solution: promises
  - `async` and `await`
- `if`, `else`
- `try`, `catch`, `raise`
- generators and iterators
- etc etc etc

Feel free to break out into as few or as many other units as seems helpful.
